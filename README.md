Expense Tracker App
________________________________________
Problem Statement
Managing money wisely can be challenging. While spending is easy, keeping track of expenses and sticking to a budget is often difficult. Uncontrolled spending can lead to financial strain, while proper tracking and thoughtful budgeting can result in savings that may prove useful in the future. Therefore, a tool that simplifies expense tracking and encourages smart spending would be highly beneficial.

Solution
To address this challenge, we propose a mobile app named "Expense Tracker." This app enables users to set a budget and log every transaction across different categories such as food, groceries, clothing, travel, and more.
The app provides two key ways to track expenses:
â€¢	A pie chart for a quick visual summary.
â€¢	A detailed list showing all expenditures.
Since itâ€™s a mobile app, it is highly accessible and convenient to use. Additionally, the app works offline, ensuring that all data is stored locally for privacy and quick access. This makes it a practical and reliable solution for managing personal finances.
